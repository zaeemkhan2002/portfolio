      This project addresses the environmental challenge of floating waste in urban waterways by developing an autonomous trash-skimming boat.
      The system uses a lightweight YOLOv12s model to detect debris and navigate toward it in real time. The hardware setup integrates a Jetson Nano (2GB),
      Arduino motor controller, and MIPI CSI camera. Due to memory constraints on the Nano, inference is performed on an offboard laptop, with detection
      results transmitted back to the boat for actuation.
      
      We trained our detection model primarily on the **Trash in Water Channels** dataset, improving validation mAP from 21.1 to 80.0 and achieving an F1 score of 0.8762.
      The pipeline includes real-time directional control based on bounding box positions, tested successfully in lab conditions.
      
      Future directions include onboard inference with upgraded hardware, autonomous search patterns, reflection-aware detection, and deployment in real aquatic environments.
